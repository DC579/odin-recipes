    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to <em>375 degrees F</em>. Line two large baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper, set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine baking soda, baking powder, and sea salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer, 
                beat together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy about <em>1 minute</em>.</li>
            <li>Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients, beat on medium speed until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the caramel and chocolate chips and stir until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Use a 1 ½ TBS cookie scoop to measure out portions of dough, 
                roll them into balls and place them evenly spaced on the two baking sheets (about 8 per sheet). 
                Repeat until all the dough is used.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for <em>8-9 minutes</em>, or until the top is just set and just barely beginning to turn light golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Then, 
                let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for <em>5-10 minutes</em>.</li>
            <li>After <em>5-10 minutes</em>, transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
